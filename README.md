## Description: 
This application has a UI that will allow for coffee connoisseurs to be a part of a growing online community. The UX creates a neat and friendly atmosphere for users to be able to view their favorite coffee shops, leave comments and view comments from other Javaphiles.
Users will also be able to access profiles based on their inputs(what they are looking for in coffee) as well as post information about their experiences that other users can see. There were a couple small challenges we had getting the front end and back end technologies to connect as well as getting the database to seed properly but we were able to work out those bugs.
